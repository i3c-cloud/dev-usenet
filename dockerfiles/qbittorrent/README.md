## qBittorrent without VPN – Bittorrent Downloader (Alternative)


Replace/Configure:

${USERDIR}/Downloads/completed – Path where to save downloaded files. ${USERDIR} is filled automatically from the environment file we created previously.
XXXX – port number on which you want the qBittorent Webui to be available at. Replace in all 3 locations in the code.
UMASK_SET – 022 is recommended. But I prefer 002 to avoid permission issues.
